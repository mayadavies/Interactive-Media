                    The Event I chose was the "Theorizing the web 2018" event. Because it seemed modern and was about art and technology, I thought I should use my display font in the poster to show the digitial look (which was my intention with the font).

                 I wanted to play around with grid formats, so I started with a less equal grids but was having trouble with the layout. I played around with rotating different lines of text to make the composition more dynamic.

                I wanted multiple types of movement so I played around with animations trying to create a glitch effect, and having the upper and lower headline moving left to right. I changed the font to something that was more bold to bring it in.I decided to add a glitchy hover effect to the cyan coloured text, so that when you hover over it, it blinks rapidly with changing colours.

                <h2>Process 4</h2>
                <p>
                    I really delve into the animations by the end and applied a gradient change animation to the body text playing slowly to make it more enjoyable to watch. To create a digital look and feel I made the first and third line of text sliging left to right and the middle line used with my display font going the opposite for a sense of dynamics. I kept in the glitch effect for the 2 cyan coloured headlines as a hover effect.Further, I added a link to the about page of the group and to make it attractable I used a glitchy animation of rapidly blinking colours to draw attention and insinuate that you can click it.
