<h2>Reading Response 1</h2>

<p>1. What are some challenges you face when giving a critique? 
<br>
<br>

Some of the challenges I face when I am giving a critique is being scared that what I have to say is not valid or that others do not agree. It can be scary to put your own opinions and thoughts out there. So I find it hard to speak up and find myself too nervous to participate. Another is that I am scared I will offend the person I am giving feedback to when my intention was to advise.I do not want people to think this is personal when it is only about the work. When all of the attention of the entire class is on one person it can be nerve wracking to say how you feel about something and your opinions when everything is subjective. It is important to create a safe space and community that people can feel comfortable sharing in. 
<br>
<br>

2. How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?
<br>
<br>

When I receive a critique I disagree with, I take it gracefully and store it in the back of my mind with the rest of the critiques. It is always important to hear from different perspectives from your own because not everyone is going to think and see like you. It may be hard to hear but it is important to know and consider to ameliorate my work later on.I want to consider everyone's thoughts and critiques when i go forward with my work whether or not I make every single change or not. Much like the reading points out, a good critique will not leave you feeling sad or angry but more so informed, therefore if the critique is respectful I will gladly take it into consideration whether I agree or not, because that is what the critique is for.
<br>
<br>

3. Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques? 
<br>
<br>

Like I mentioned before, critiques are important because it is important to step out of your own shoes and understand what your work does for other observers. It is important to hear other people's perspectives and opinions, being able to have feedback from other creatives will strengthen your work because everyone has different strengths and ideas to bring to the table to make good work. When you throw yourself into a project it is hard to take a step back and detach yourself from your work to think critically about changes, because you become attached to every single detail, so I think it is really important to have others play that role for you. Just like it is important to give feedback to others, you can be the fresh pair of eyes to help a peer make their strongest work. </p>

1. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.
<br>
<br>
 After reading “What Screens Want”  by Frank Chimero, it solidified my opinion that I personally don’t think it matters if you use flat or skeuo design for screens. The screen can show both effectively and I think as much as it is an aesthetic choice it also depends on the function of the design, the message it conveys and the theme. Much like Chimero had mentioned, design always has more depth to it than purely aesthetic reasons so therefore I think both skeuo and flat design work depending on the situation. Perhaps if you want to make something feel more futuristic and have a of a more physical-interaction feel, skeuo designs are the way to go, but maybe simple graphics don’t need to go that far to convey their message. All in all screens display both types effectively and I don’t think it is necessary to choose only one, design is innovative and allowing skeuomorph and flat designs can create great work.

<br>

2. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
<br>
<br>
A Zoopraxiscope is a method in which is used to animate a series of still images to create motion (or  stop motion), this technique was invented by the photographer Eadweard Muybridge. This relates to web and interaction design because there are many digital elements online now that have taken inspiration from the zoopraxiscope, for example, GIFs and Boomerangs which are huge in the digital design world. Further this was an introduction of movement on screens. I am not quite sure if this is true, but I feel as if another inspiration from digital design was taken from the way movies displayed credits on the screen, it never swiped or went side to side, flipping pages like a book, but kept scrolling down and down displaying more credits, and now on almost every web interface you navigate the page by scrolling down to view more information much like the credits. Further I think a huge influence was animated films, they are always creative and playful, the way they make things appear on the screen creatively jumping or spinning, which can relate to how some buttons and texts are displayed on screens when you interact with them, they spin or blink etc...
<br>
<br>
3. Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.
<br>
<br>
I agree with Frank Chimero, that screens want “flux”. Screens are most often used to display some function, whether it does it on its own or with your interaction. If we wanted to display something completely static why not use paper? We need constant change as a way to engage with the screen which can be otherwise alienating. Screens have this way of seeming “awake/alive” So little details such as turning into night mode colouring at night gives the sense that this is more than something that displays words and pictures, it gives a full personalized engaging experience. Chimero states “It’s not tied to an aesthetic. Screens don’t care what the horses look like. They just want them to move. They want the horses to change.” This supports the idea that screens are about displaying movement and change and being alive, it is not a static object it's more engaging and interactive. The screen does not serve the sole purpose of displaying imagery, like Chimero mentions,it also manages movement and time, meaning its purpose is to do more than one thing and it relies on all three to be successful.

1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? 
<br>
<br>
I believe Lialina’s opinion of the word “users” is that she believes it is outdated. It references  a different period of time where technology was used differently, she says in the article that “interfaces are for users and experiences are for the people ''. Nowadays technology has become much easier to use and much more personal and common. You can have up to no knowledge and still use an Ipad, so she believes the people we are desigingin for now are merely people, not users. She also talks about how it reminds designers and software developers that they are creating for human beings, which is lost a lot of the time. Especially where we are at, technology is for humans and I believe she thinks the word User is no longer applicable in this technological climate. However, she does not fully believe in the rejection of the word completely, because as she states it makes you forget about the involvement of computers, and that is still there, and anyone interacting with technology is indeed a user, while the term may be impersonal and potentially outdated. impersonal??
<br>
<br>
2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.
<br>
<br>
Lialina writes about how primarily users were seen as people “too busy with something else”,or that they wanted isolated apps for each specific activity. However this is not completely how she sees it. She sees users who are creative, who can find multiple ways to achieve their goal. By creative I mean that people are smart, a she mentions about the multiple browsers signed into multiple twitter accounts, people find unique ways to use the internet for various purposes, users don’t want a single purpose they want multiple purposes and interactions. For example she states “General Purpose Users can write an article in their email client, layout their business card in Excel and shave in front of a webcam.”. So, her ideal internet users are people who are smart and creative, open to finding unique ways to make the internet work for 
<br>
<br>
3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?
<br>
<br>
When I think of examples on the web where gaps can be filled by users, I think of instances where it may be simple, but maY require some effort or knowledge or simply time. It is not made so blatantly obvious, but it works. The first example I thought of (and yes these may not be COMPLETELY legal) but are very common with internet users, is websites where people can download music from youtube to their devices. Because the website is not 100% legal, it is not completely slick and made very easy for users, it is a low effort site so people can listen to music they want. You have to know what to do when you plug in the link and install and download, where to find it in your desktop and how to make sure it works in your music library, there is not always a magical button that makes it show up in all your playlists and correct file locations. Another example I think of is streaming movies. I stream movies a lot, particularly foreign films which means they are rare to find and play easily. However, after time and getting used to it has become a great way for me to watch movies, I know how to find the correct subtitles that I must upload onto the site and make sure the timing lines up with the audio. I know that I have to click play 5 times to be taken to external sites before it really plays, but after time and effort it is simple.

1. Why does Laurel Schwulst (Links to an external site.) (Links to an external site.)advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.
<br>
<br>

Laurel Schwulst expresses that personal/individual websites are better than social media, especially for artists. She explains this by explaining how artists create worlds, from inside and out, the rules, the language etc... This is why an individual website is more effective than simply having a social media account, it is more unique and the person can have full control over the architecture of the site. I agree with Schwulst’s opinion, because I find with social media, the extent in which you can fully express yourself and your work and who you are is limited ( to placing photos into white squares and writing a short bio), When you view an artists individual website compared to their instagram, it is much more impactful and gives you much more understanding to who they are. It gives the artist control over every aspect of the  platform, from the colours, to the functions etc...Like she says, an artists creates worlds, and you can’t efficiently show an entire world in an instagram grid.      
<br>
<br>

2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here:

	1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?
	<br>
<br>
 When Seu asks us to “familiarize ourselves with our tools” I think she is highlighting the fact that everyone is used to the same interactions with their technology interfaces, however we don’t fully understand or question them. She mentions how knowing limitations in technology can help identify the poetic potential. What I think is meant by this and how this relates do defamiliarizing ourselves with our tools, is that everyone is so fascinated with the novelty behind new technology that people don’t take the time to fully understand them and their potentials and constraints, we merely accept them for what they are without looking deeper,by defamiliarizing ourselves with these tools, we can take a step back to understand them in a different way, to be able to use the technology in a profound and more meaningful way, like creating art and using technology as a poetic device rather than just creating huge glamorous works that may not reach the technologies full potential. 
<br>
<br>
 

2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.
	<br>
<br>
 

From what I understand, “Removing form from function” is a way of separating the physical purpose from the aesthetics of digital components. It is using regular digital features to highlight its beauty and aesthetics, for more of a visual experience rather than purely for its use. An example I found where this tool was used is a website made for M+, Hong Kong's visual culture museum. The designer artfully layed out the text all around the page going different directions, creating more of an art piece than an informational looking site, further the designer made use of the scrolling through text function and it turned it into an aesthetically pleasing and visually fun piece that was less about the reading and more about the overall effect of all the different text boxes scrolling different ways creating a unique effect. This is not a perfect example as it is not completely abstract and still has an informational purpose, but elements of that tool are shown, through making it look more like an interactive art piece and taking advantage of text layout and scrolling.
