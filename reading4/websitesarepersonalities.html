<h3> <i> Who</i> are you? </h3>
 <p>  
A website is like it's someone's unique personality. Each individual is unique to one another. You enter the website and you can see its quirks, what it likes and is passionate about, the different pages bring you to the different aspects of the personality, but the overall feel of the website is succinct much like someone's personality. They may have a wide range of interests and opinions but there is always something that ties it all together. Some people choose to express their personality in their appearance to the extreme, while others not as much, however to whatever extent, the appearance of the person (or the site) always reflects the personality. For example, let's say this website is for someone's home made pottery business, it focuses on sustainable and local materials, it is a local business with ties to the community, the website would reflect all aspects of that personality, when you enter the website the content and appearance, and functionality etc would all use elements that would create this personality. Maybe pastel colours, a script like font, simple navigation nothing to high tech, and everything that reflects that personality, so that when someone visits that site they know who the site is.</p>
