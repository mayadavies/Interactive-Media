                <p>
                    I started the assignment by doing research on my interaction with “hover” uses. I looked at its original function and it was originally used to reveal that the information could be interactive with, by hovering over the button it would change to indicate you could press it. I learned it had multiple different names such as “roll over”, “mouse over” and “tool tip”. I learned that this function is locationally specific and creates a 3d surface out of an originally 2d surface, by creating layers literally and metaphorically. With that in mind I wanted to play off the idea of people seeking out to find more because the way I understood it “hover” reveals more depth than what is originally seen. I did some research on some ways to use the hover function in unique ways and put files into my <a href="https://www.are.na/share/eZNPUsD">Are.na</a> , and also looked into aesthetics I was interested in and with my idea of finding deeper meanings I wanted to do something with an occult aesthetic.

                <p>
                    I decided to have hidden text that would be revealed when hovering over areas. I had not decided at this point how it would change or be revealed but I was playing with different colours, fonts and the exact message I wanted to get across.

                <p>
                    I was still a bit unsure of my layout and looked, because I was a bit lost and trying to find the best way to have the hidden text revealed. So this was the beginning of seeing where everything might fit. I knew I wanted it to look minimalist because the information would be revealed upon hovering.

                <p>
                    I decided I wanted it to be a bit like a flashlight where the cursor would in a way illuminate or reval the text in small sections, so I googled how to make custom cursors and foune one where you could create a circle cursor, and from there I experimented with size and colour and how it would work with my interaction.

                <h2> Step 3</h2>
                <p>
                   I realized I felt like I was missing something so I thought to go further I would have something people search for which might be different ,multiple times. So I decided to have people use their cursor to reveal their fortune. I also experimented with colors more and found darker colours against a brighter one for the cursor worked much more for my interaction.

                <p>
                   Now that I had the bulk of my idea, all that was left was experimenting with style. So I experimented with contrasting colors and blackletter/script fonts. I added animations to the hover interactions so when the "flashlight" hovered over words they would slowly illuminate.

                <p>
                    I found the most effective font and finalized the colors I wanted to use, and decided to add a goodbye message that may be a bit creepier to add to the occult aesthetic, so I wadded one more animation on the goodbye text that caused it to flicker, and there you have my interactive site for “hover”.
