                I wanted to create a typeface that was reminicent of early decorative/digital fonts. So I decided to play around with squares and circles to create a very grid-like style of letter much like you would see on a digital clock. So I played around witht he border-radius of the shapes to get comfortable.

                <p>
                    I felt as if my first type-set was too simple or not styled enough, so I decided to play further with the border-radius curves, and inverting them to create a more unique/decorative font.

                    I still felt as if something was missing and felt like I was drifting from my initial digital look. So I searched up different box-shadow settings and colours other people have shared to make my design more unique. I stumbled upon a multilayer gradient style boz-shadow that gave a digital-hazey feel which I felt added alot.

                <h2>Process stage: 4</h2>
                <p>
                For the final stage not much has changed, I liked the look and wanted to play around with colour and i found that adding a bright colour similar to the box-shadow would make it even more hazy, and give it a vintage digital look and so I chose a bright pink to match.
