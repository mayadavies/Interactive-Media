                I wanted to create something with bright colours. I went through pinterest and found some colour inspiration. Then I created the style guid which got me on the right track to begin creating my site. Below is an examplke of my inspiration.

                </p>

                <!-- Start of image with caption -->
                <figure>
                  <img src="images/pinterest.jpg" width="100%">
                
                </figure>
                <!-- End of image with caption -->
            </div>
            <!-- End of a section -->
            <!-- Start of a new section -->
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Process stage: 2</h2>
                <p>
                   I Was struggling with how I wanted to display my links, so I played around with layout and body text snd colours to see hopw it would look but I could not quite capture what I was going for.
                </p>
                <!-- Start of a section -->
                <!-- Start of image with caption -->
                
                  <img src="images/first.png" width="100%">
                  <figcaption>
               
                <!-- End of image with caption -->
            </div>
            <!-- End of a new section -->
              <div class="section">
                <h2>Process stage: 3</h2>
                <p>
                    After moving on I decided to add in some effects, so I decided to add the random color background effect after I established my color palette. Then. I played around with the links animations to make them seem as if they were floating around temporarily before landing into place.
                </p>
                <!-- Start of a section -->
                <!-- Start of image with caption -->
                <figure>
                  <img src="images/third.png"width="100%">
                  <figcaption>
                
        
</div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Process stage: 4</h2>
                <p>
                I realized I had not added enough interactivity. So I looked into some button events and was trying to learn how to use them so I could figure out how I could use them n my index properly.
                </p>
                <!-- Start of a section -->
                <!-- Start of image with caption -->
                <figure>
                  <img src="images/fourth.png"width="100%">
                  <figcaption>
                
                </figure>
        </div>
    
        <!-- End of content -->
    </div>

    <div class="section">
                <h2>Process stage: 5</h2>
                <p>
                I changed the layount so there would be more balance on either side of the screen. I began to edit the buttons to match my style guide and played around with ways i could use the buttons, like adding sighn off phrases or other options to give the viewer the option to chose.
                </p>
                <!-- Start of a section -->
                <!-- Start of image with caption -->
                <figure>
                  <img src="images/fifth.png"width="100%">
                  <figcaption>
                
                </figure>
        </div>
    
        <!-- End of content -->
    </div>

        <div class="section">
                <h2>Process stage: 6</h2>
                <p>
                By the end I was polishing off the layout and coloring and making sure the animations worked well and were responsive because I was having trouble making them work for both views. I played with line spacing and color animations to make the site more dynamic and constantly in action, and with that I finalized my design.
